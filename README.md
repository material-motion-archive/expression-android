# Material Motion Android Expression

This Expression library allows you to define your own Expression Family.
See the `sample/` application for an example of a custom Expression
Family.

## Depending on the library

### Using Jitpack

Jitpack allows you to easily add a dependency on any of the [published releases](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-expression-android/releases)
for this library.

Add the Jitpack repository to your project's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

When starting out with a project it is likely that you will want to use
the latest version of the library.
Add the dependency to your module's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.material-motion:material-motion-expression-android:+'
}
```

Later on in the project you may want to freeze to a specific version of
the library. This is **highly recommended** because it makes your builds
predictable and reproducible. Take care to occasionally [check for updates](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin).

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.material-motion:material-motion-expression-android:1.0.0'
}
```

It is also possible to specify a *dynamic version* range. This is useful
to stay up to date on a major version, without the risk of new library releases
introducing breaking changes into your project.

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.material-motion:material-motion-expression-android:1.+'
}
```

For more information regarding versioning, see:

- [Gradle Documentation on Dynamic Versions](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html#sub:dynamic_versions_and_changing_modules)
- [Material Motion Versioning Policies](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-team/content/essentials/core_team_contributors/release_process.html#versioning)

### Using the files from a folder local to the machine

If you would like to edit this library in tandem with its client project
you can use `:local`.

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.material-motion:material-motion-expression-android:local'
}
```

To use this option, you must run `gradle install` from the library's
project root every time you want local changes in the library to
propagate to the clients.
