## Bootstrap script

The bootstrap script creates the skeletal directory structure for an
Android library repo.
This script must be provided a library name, package name, github group,
and github repo.

Example usage:

    # Create ~/MyLibrary and populate with this repo.
    cd ~/MyLibrary
    ./bootstrap.sh MyLibrary com.example.library github-username github-repo
